2,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,"Too much text on the red, maybe use icons or other ways to simplify getting that info across and offer ways to get to alternatives such as the garages mentioned ",Yes,3 - Some,1 - Very Difficult,"Need a ""you are here"" , differentiation of the thickness of lines on the green/by importance of information",Yes,3 - Some,3 - Neutral,"Contextual ""where am I"" in relation to the suggestions, also too much text, maybe have parking availability ranges 0, 1-3, 4+, and parking capacity",Yes,2 - A little,2 - Difficult,"Feels like construction roadsigns, may need to capture if it's two way or one way traffic and on which side of street",Prototype 3 - Garage comparison with walk-distance slide,"Garage is most straightforward, if street parking need to indicate which side of street, two way or one way traffic"
3,Yes,3 - Some,2 - Difficult,voice control,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,voice control,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,voice control,Yes,3 - Some,3 - Neutral,more labels,Prototype 3 - Garage comparison with walk-distance slide,3
4,Yes,5 - Completely,5 - Very Easy,"""Warning to tell you difficult to parking"" is best",Yes,5 - Completely,5 - Very Easy,"Perfect, very like ""different colors to show how the parking is busy""",Yes,5 - Completely,5 - Very Easy,"perfect, distance bar and filter",Yes,5 - Completely,5 - Very Easy,Colors to tell you how parking is,Prototype 1 - Parking Mode,1
5,Yes,3 - Some,3 - Neutral,A quick drop expand arrow to have a quick glance at the proposed path on a map.,Yes,2 - A little,2 - Difficult,"Add street names for the side streets. Differentiate the location marker from the other lines, the red on red makes it hard to spot. Hide the legend since it blocks some of the view. Add indicators of parking limits. Even if parking is open, sometimes streets have 2 hour limits when you're going somewhere for 4.",Yes,3 - Some,4 - Easy,Reduce the amount of text. Also the pricing is not clear if that's per hour or expected $ amount for my intended parking. The intended parking time can span multiple price tiers and that's part of the consideration.,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,Parking limits.,Prototype 4 - Dynamic Road Signage,"2 & 4 combined would help a lot. However, this is hard to compare because option 3 is just for garages."
6,Yes,2 - A little,3 - Neutral,Reduce the amount of text,Yes,4 - A lot,3 - Neutral,Focus only on streets with ample parking,Yes,3 - Some,4 - Easy,It only focuses on garages and none of the street like the other prototype,Yes,4 - A lot,5 - Very Easy,"It seems to be overly simple, maybe a bit more details would be nice",Prototype 4 - Dynamic Road Signage,"People like to know exactly what to do, which is why everyone uses navigation even when driving to a destination they know the path to"
7,Yes,2 - A little,3 - Neutral,"I think you could reduce cognitive load while driving by letting users start navigation with a single button. The default could guide them to street parking, and if they prefer garage parking, they could simply press an “alternative” button. This way, they wouldn’t need to pick a destination first and then tap “start navigation.”",Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,I think you could change the destination pin color so it doesn’t blend in with the difficult-parking roads.,Yes,2 - A little,2 - Difficult,I think you could reduce the amount of on-screen text and use color or visual styling instead. This would keep the interface cleaner and make key information easier to understand at a glance.,Yes,3 - Some,4 - Easy,"Universal icons for parking (e.g., a check mark, exclamation point, or “X” symbol) in addition to color.",Prototype 2 - Color-coded street overlays,2 and 4

11,Yes,3 - Some,3 - Neutral,Focusing on the type of parking and respective likelihood at the destination. Eg Street Parking - Difficult. Parking Garage - Moderate (maybe incl price). Valet - Easily available etc,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,The location marker and red colored streets were clashing. Feature wise maybe a secondary marker for the parking spot that also then shows the quickest walking path to the final destination.,Yes,3 - Some,2 - Difficult,"Not displaying the closed lots. Only providing top 2-3 options with only 3-4 bits of info like price, walking distance from destination, safety/rating. Tapping a choice should reveal further info like location, spots etc",Yes,2 - A little,2 - Difficult,Some indicator on how far you are from the destination.,Prototype 1 - Parking Mode,1 and 3

Is it referring to time it takes to park, time to get there, time delay?",Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,"If this is signage, how would it change? Is this electronic signage? Is someone out there actively updating the sign? How would this be reliable?",Prototype 2 - Color-coded street overlays,2 and 3

14,Yes,3 - Some,4 - Easy,Add clearer real-time availability indicators instead of relying only on mode switching.,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,Make the color-coding legend persist on-screen so drivers don’t have to recall meanings.,Yes,4 - A lot,3 - Neutral,Surface the walk-distance slider more prominently and show estimated walking times.,Yes,3 - Some,5 - Very Easy,Increase contrast and add directional arrows pointing to the nearest available area.,Prototype 2 - Color-coded street overlays,A combination of Prototype 2’s color-coded street overlays and Prototype 4’s dynamic signage for both pre-arrival awareness and real-time on-road guidance.
15,Yes,4 - A lot,5 - Very Easy,show a map of street parking likelihood,Yes,4 - A lot,5 - Very Easy,trusting the predictions,Yes,4 - A lot,3 - Neutral,ideally we would select the parking before the trip. It might be harder to evaluate the options after starting the drive.,Yes,4 - A lot,5 - Very Easy,"more precise information, like number of spots available",Prototype 1 - Parking Mode,2
16,Yes,2 - A little,4 - Easy,I think inlacing miles and minutes to the next parking spot would be nice,Yes,3 - Some,4 - Easy,it's not very obvious what the layer icon means on the top left,Yes,4 - A lot,4 - Easy,The top says distance but then the bar is in minutes. Seems a bit confusing here.,Yes,1 - Not at all,2 - Difficult,Im not exactly sure how to look at this prototype. I think having street labels would help a lot here.,Prototype 3 - Garage comparison with walk-distance slide,I would prefer p3 because I would personally still go to the parking areas that are labeled as full thinking someone might leave before the app updates. If I still cannot find parking even after that then finding a garage nearby would be my next move.
